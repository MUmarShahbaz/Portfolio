## üîß Key Features

- **Enhanced User Interface**  
  A cleaner, more intuitive UI for a seamless user experience.

- **Light & Dark Mode Support**  
  Switch between light and dark themes based on your preference or environment.

- **Plug and Play**  
  No installation required‚Äîsimply open the link and start using immediately.

- **Offline Access**  
  Fully local functionality‚Äîdownload the repo and host the site locally for use without an internet connection.

- **Unlimited Plotting**  
  Visualize as many data streams as you need without restrictions.

- **Custom Communication Settings**  
  Define your own baud rate, break characters, and clear screen (CLS) characters for flexible serial communication.

- **Real-Time Console Logging**  
  View raw serial data logs alongside plotted visuals.

- **Flexible Plotting Options**  
  Plot data by index or timestamp depending on your use case.

- **Multiple Scale Types**  
  Choose between linear, logarithmic (base 2), and logarithmic (base 10) scales.

- **Support for Null Values**  
  Handles incomplete or missing data gracefully during plotting.

- **Auto CLS**  
  Automatically clears screen after the number of collected data has passed a pre-defined threshold.

- **Auto-Scaling Y-Axis**  
  Automatically adjusts the Y-axis range for optimal data visibility.

- **Interactive Visualization**  
  Zoom in and explore plots dynamically with a responsive, interactive graphing interface.

### Example of Interactivity

## üìà Plotting Modes

The plotter supports three distinct modes to fit a variety of use cases, ranging from general-purpose visualization to precision timing:

- **Index Mode**  
  Plots data against its sequence index. This mode creates a consistent and unchanging X-axis where each point represents the order in which the data was received.

- **Automatic Time Scaling**  
  Utilizes the system's internal clock to timestamp data upon arrival and uses those values on the X-axis. Suitable for general time-based plotting, but may not offer precise millisecond accuracy due to background processing delays.

- **Manual Time Scaling**  
  Treats the first value in each data packet as the timestamp (typically in milliseconds). Ideal for high-precision plots‚Äîespecially when using functions like `millis()` in Arduino-based applications. This mode offers the most reliable timing accuracy for microcontroller data.

## üì§ Data Format

Here is a little "behind-the-scenes" for how the data is processed.

```javascript
function DataProcessor(message, timeReceived) {
  if (message === cls_char) {             // Clear Previous Data
    clearData();
  } else {
    let data = message.split(break_char); // Separate using break_char
    if (xAxisType === 'time') {
      if (manualTime) {
        addTime(data[0]);                 // Add first value to x axis and remove it from data
        data.shift();
      } else {
        addTime(timeReceived);            // Add time received at to x axis
      }
    }
    addData(data);                        // Add remaining data to the chart

    counter++;                            // Erase data if too much is collected
    if (counter > maxPoints) {
      clearData();
      counter = 0;
    }
  }
}
```

There are 2 basic things you need to keep in mind:
- Each value should be separated by the configured **break character**.
- The data line must end with a newline (<span class="inline-code">\n</span>).

### üßπ Clear Screen Command

To clear all previously collected data, simply send the configured **cls character**

This will reset the plotter and erase existing data.

### ‚è± Manual Time Scaling Note

If you're using **Manual Time Scale** mode, the first value is treated as the **timestamp in milliseconds**.  
This is ideal for use with <span class="inline-code">millis()</span> in Arduino or similar microcontrollers.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Page

All configuration options are available on the **Setup** page.  
You can customize parameters such as baud rate, break/CLS characters, plot types, and more.

A built-in **Help** section is also provided to explain the purpose and functionality of each setting‚Äîperfect for new users or quick reference.

## üé® Themes

The application supports both **Light** and **Dark** themes to suit different environments and user preferences.

You can toggle between themes anytime.  
Your selected theme is automatically applied across all pages for a consistent visual experience.

## üåê Browser Requirements

To ensure full functionality, your browser must support the following:

- **Web Serial API** ‚Äì Required for direct communication with serial devices.  
  *Supported in Chromium-based browsers like Chrome, Edge, and Opera.*

- **JavaScript** ‚Äì Core functionality and interactivity rely heavily on JavaScript.

- **HTML5** ‚Äì Ensures proper rendering of structural elements.

- **CSS3** ‚Äì Required for styling, responsive layout, and theming (Light/Dark Mode).
