# Arduino Toolbox ‚Äì The Ultimate Utility for Robotic Arm Diagnostics  

Arduino Toolbox is a WinForms application designed for diagnosing and testing robotic arms. Whether you're developing a robotic system or troubleshooting an existing one, this toolbox provides essential tools to analyze movement, detect faults, and ensure precise control.  

Robotic arms rely on accurate servo movements and sensor feedback, making real-time monitoring crucial. Arduino Toolbox simplifies this process by offering a Serial Monitor, Gyro Reader, and Servo Controller, all designed to work efficiently over UART communication.  

## Key Features  

### üîç Built-in Serial Monitor  
Unlike traditional serial monitors like the one in the Arduino IDE, which logs data in a multiline format, Arduino Toolbox presents incoming serial data on a single updating line. This makes it easier to identify patterns and verify if the robotic arm's output is formatted correctly without scrolling through excessive text. This is particularly useful for debugging structured data like sensor readings or control signals.  

### üì° Gyro Reader ‚Äì Real-Time Orientation Tracking  
For robotic arms equipped with MEMS gyroscopes, the Gyro Reader provides graphical, real-time visualization of pitch and roll data. This helps developers track orientation changes dynamically, ensuring mechanical components move as expected. Whether you're testing balance, stability, or rotational movement, this feature gives immediate feedback on how the robotic arm responds to motion.  

### üéõÔ∏è Servo Controller ‚Äì Intuitive Motion Control  
Robotic arms depend on precise servo movements, and Arduino Toolbox includes a Servo Controller to fine-tune each joint in real time. The controller features:  
- Four independent sliders for adjusting servo positions  
- A live graphical representation of the robotic arm that updates as servos move  

## Why Use Arduino Toolbox?  
- Eliminate guesswork ‚Äì See live sensor data and servo positions  
- Enhance debugging ‚Äì Quickly identify communication errors and movement faults  
- Improve efficiency ‚Äì Simplify robotic arm testing, calibration, and troubleshooting
